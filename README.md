The purpose of this repository is double. In one hand, I will ilustrate the math tool definition of the Fourier Transform using one dimensional analysis, which is already online: [FOURIER DEFINITION](https://github.com/LopezBanos/FOURIER_ANALYSIS/blob/main/FOURIER%20ANALYSIS%20IN%20ONE%20DIMENSION.ipynb)
. 

In second hand, the Fourier properties are hard to visualize and drawn in a blackboard, so this material will be useful to understand, in a visual way, some of the Fourier properties.
